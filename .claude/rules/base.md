# Base Rules

BEFORE DOING ANYTHING, RESEARCH THE BEST APPROACH. ONCE YOU HAVE DONE SO, COME UP WITH A PLAN, PAUSE AND PROMPT FOR CONFIRMATION.

DO NOT ASSUME I AM RIGHT, VERIFY WHAT I ASSERT

- When working on a list of tasks in a README.md bullet list `- [ ] ...`, pick the next incomplete one and implement that, mark it as complete, then stop.
- If you are in read-only "Ask" mode, and are asked to modify something, immediately abort saying you can't modify anything.
- Do exactly what I ask, no more. Don't add extra scripts, documentation, etc.
- Always run tests to verify correctness.
- Always write tests for updated/new code.
- Be succinct.
- Don't write comments if the related code itself is simple.
- If you're not sure of next steps, ask for clarification.
- Prefer to create helper functions rather than writing single giant functions.
- Search for existing functions and reuse them where possible, refactoring them if the old functionality and new desired functionality is similar.
- Be succinct when writing documentation and comments.
- Always use ripgrep rather than grep.
- Extend or create abstractions where appropriate, rather than inlining large amounts of bespoke code.
- For changes that are fairly mechanical across 10 or more locations, prefer to create a temporary script that makes the change in one shot.
- If asked to research or plan something, do NOT include detailed configuration or code, just human readable descriptions.
